# Ruby on Rails Udemy course: Project 1
This is a project I built following [Mashrur Hossain's Ruby on Rails Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/)
At the time I had only completed basic Ruby tutorials and exercises so much of the content was a little beyond my understanding. 
However this was something I understood going in, as it was intended to be a crash course/ prep for Makers.
