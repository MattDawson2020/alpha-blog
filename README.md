# Ruby on Rails Udemy course

```
This is a project I built following [Mashrur Hossain's Ruby on Rails Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/)
```
At the time I had only completed basic Ruby tutorials and exercises so much of the content was a little beyond my understanding. 
However this was something I understood going in, as it was intended to be a crash course/ prep for Makers.


```
From this I gained preliminary understanding into:
```
-The MVC model, and what each of them did
-Git and basic version control/ repositories
-Basic HTML, CSS and SemanticUI
-What a framework is and how they worked
-The basics of Ruby on Rails, which would come back to help greatly in Makers week 8
